# Breathing Room

App that helps to run a breathing room.
A breathing room is a short, 3-part meditation.
After part 1 and 2 a single beep will sound.
After part 3 a double beep will indicate the end.
The app will log your session.

## Parts

1. Pay attention to your body
2. Pay attention to your breathing
3. Pay attention to everything in and around you

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in the browser
- Click "Start"

## Plans

I plan to extend this app.

- (optional) Hide the countdown timer
- Allow showing the log
- (optional) Show written instructions for all parts
- Show/edit log
- Make visually nicer
- Different sounds for intervalls
